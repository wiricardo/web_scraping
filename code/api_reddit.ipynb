Further, their parents are gen xers and Elder Millennials at this point, and they are typically having fewer kids and having them later to begin with.

Many colleges relied on international students as a source of steady income because they do not receive financial aid. \\n\\nThis puts colleges in a very tough spot because colleges can spiral very quickly. If they close down a program, the students that were going to attend that program frequently leave, and the problem gets worse.  So colleges have to be very careful about planning for the future.

Colleges are also far less likely to make tenure track professors.  \\n\\nThe more Elite colleges in California and the Northeast are somewhat more insulated because they have a broader pool of potential admissions to draw on.   \\n\\nMore liberal states are also more likely to apply state funding to bail out colleges to ensure that their college education system maintains robust programs.   \\n\\nRed states, on the other hand, are frequently doing nothing or pumping up trade school programs.
